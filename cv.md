# About myself
Nowadays I’m a BIM-manager in civil engineering company. It’s too hart to describe my responsibilities, because there is a big number of different tasks. ( building information model done with high quality is my product. To implement my work on high level, I use to work with visual programming and python. It’s necessary to have knowledge base of materials and special documents and I suppose that front-end development is useful to solve this task. I have big motivation to learn hard and improve my professional level.
